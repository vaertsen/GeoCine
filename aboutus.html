	<h2>ABOUT US</h2>

	<p>
	This website is developed by a group of researchers at the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, who, from various disciplines, have a common interest in the study of the relationship between geographical space and cinema.
	</p>
	<p>
	Because of the need to provide educational content relevant to students of Journalism and Audiovisual Communication who were studying subjects of geography, Agustín Gámir and Carlos Manuel, both geographers, proceeded to collect academic papers related to geographic contents which are shown, either directly or indirectly, in fiction films. Given the scarcity of references, a line of research that although already had some prominent representatives in several European countries and in the United States and Canada, in the case of Spain was practically in its initial stages.
	</p>
	<p>
	Later, Victor Aertsen, whose training combines Audiovisual Communication, Information Technology and Humanities and who shared similar concerns, joined this research.
	</p>
	<p>
	This group has been responsible for writing various documents in the form of monographs, articles in academic journals and conference papers, in which some aspects of geography-film relationship develop. According to the specific characteristics of fiction films, we believe that some of these research and analysis should be presented in video – essay format. Several of these articles and video -essays have emerged within various research projects whose characteristics are shown in other sections of this website.
	</p>
	<p>
	This site would not have been possible without the support of a large group of people who have given us an invaluable assistance. Among them we should point researchers from the Faculty of Humanities, Communication and Documentation at the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid as Ana Mejón, Jaime López, José Cuevas; also, the staff of the Library “Carmen Martin Gaite”: Lola Santonja, Inmaculada Muro, Francisco López and Mar Bujalance .
	</p>
	<p>
	In addition, other professors from various Spanish universities are collaborating on the contents shown here. This is the case of the geographers Diego Barrado and Antonia Sáez (Universidad Autónoma de Madrid), and professor Luis Deltell (Audiovisual Communication; Universidad Complutense de Madrid).
